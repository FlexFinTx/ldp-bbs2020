This specification describes the BBS+ Signature Suite created in 2020
for the Linked Data Proof specification. The Signature Suite utilizes
the BBS signature mechanism to provide signatures that feature zero knowledge
proof disclosure capabilities.
      </p>

This is an experimental specification and is undergoing regular revisions. It
is not fit for production deployment.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
This specification defines a set of cryptographic suites for the purpose of creating, verifying and deriving proofs
for BBS+ Signatures in conformance with the Linked Data Proofs [[LD-PROOFS]] specification. 
      </p>
      <p>
In general the suites uses the RDF Dataset Normalization Algorithm [[RDF-DATASET-NORMALIZATION]] to transform an
input document into its canonical form. It then uses the <a>statement digest algorithm</a> 
to digest each statement to be signed individually, finally the digested statements are signed
using the defined <a>signature algorithm</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
BBS Signatures were first defined in [[SHORT-GROUP-SIGNATURES]]
and later improved on in [[ASM]] as BBS+ and touched on again in section 4.3 in [[ANON-ATTESTATION-DH]].
      </p>
      <p>
BBS+ signatures are compatible with any pairing friendly elliptic curve, however the cryptographic 
suites defined in this document elect to only allow the usage of the BLS12-381 for interoperability purposes.
      </p>

      <h2>BLS12-381</h2>
      <p>
Defined in [[PAIRING-FRIENDLY-CURVES]], BLS12-381 is an elliptic curve that features a unique property 
only present in a subset of elliptic curves known as being pairing friendly.  
      </p>
      <p>
Because of the pairing friendly property, BLS12-381 can be used to construct digital signatures
that have unique properties, such as aggregatable (TODO reference) signatures and or signatures
that support zero knowledge proof (TODO reference) disclosure.
      </p>
      

<div class="issue">TODO: Is the the below the correct place for the rationale?</div>

      <p>
With pairing friendly elliptic curves, there are two fields, denoted G1 and G2, for 
which signatures and public keys can exist. Importantly however both the public
key and a signature generated using the public key cannot exist in the same field.
      </p>
      <p>
Due to the properties of the two fields, there are different associated performance
characteristics to selecting which field to use for signatures vs which field to use 
for public key generation. In general operations are faster in G1 and the resulting commitments 
are smaller. With this definition of BBS+ signatures we have opted for signatures to be faster
and smaller to create rather than key generation.
      </p>
        
  
<section>
  <h3><dfn>Bls12381G2Key2020</dfn></h3>

  <p>
    The key MUST have a property <code>publicKeyBase58</code> and its value 
    MUST be a base58 encoded BLS12-381 public key in the G2 field. Where the 
    BLS12-381 public key is the concatenation of the 2 raw 48 byte x co-ordinates
    defining the commitment.

            In order to support selective disclosure of <a>statement</a>s, 
            the create verify data algorithm has been modified from

          The algorithm defined below, outlines the process of obtaining the data in the form
